Release notes for fcs v0.0.4.
-----------------------------

### API changes

#### New class: FCSWriteStream  (fcswritestream.js)

This class uses the logic from v0.0.3's **FCS.readStreamAsync()** to implement a node-style **WriteableStream** to which you can pipe data from a FCS file.
You could use it directly, but it is probably best to use

#### var fws = FCS.prepareWriteableStream(callback, readableStream)

+ **callback**, if provided, will get called at the end as `callback(error, fcs)`, otherwise, you must setup your own listeners.
+ **readableStream** is also optional, but passing it makes things a bit more efficient.

Once things are setup, call    **somereadableStream.pipe(fws);**  
See examples/fcshttp.js or the updated **fcs.readStreamAsync()** for example use.  Note that readStreamAsync() is now a short method using **FCSWriteStream** to do the real work.

### Enhancements to Example programs

examples/http.js and examples/fcshttp.html now have a direct file upload feature that usually works, but seems to be a bit buggy.  This is an area outside of my expertise.

### Improved unit tests for better coverage.

Istanbul/mocha says line coverage is up to 77%, function coverage is at 89%.
