Release notes for fcs v0.0.3.
-----------------------------

### API change

Added a major new method for asynchronous reading.  Somewhat tested. 

#### readStreamAsync(stream, moreOptions, callback)
  
Will read the file asynchronously, and, when done, call `callback(err, self)`
In the case of huge files of which you are reading few or no events, this may save a lot of time and I/O.
It's also more "node-like".

### New Features

- Some of the example FCS files have funky analysis segments, take measures to massage them.
  e.g. Millipore puts in XML, so don't try to parse that into key/value pairs.
  [Example JSON outputs are here](http://flyingspaniel.com/fcs/examples/)
