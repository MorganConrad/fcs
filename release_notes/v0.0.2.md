Release notes for fcs v0.0.2.
-----------------------------

###API change

I decided that having accessor methods with the same name as the underlying property was
confusing, and also a *bad* idea.  All the accessors have been renamed `getXXX()`

Added a "base" accessor, `get(segment, keywords)`.  The other accessors use this method.

###Bug fixes

- [Bug#01](https://github.com/MorganConrad/fcs/issues/1) fixed.  ANALYSIS segment now prints.  If not present, will print as '{ }'
- fixed bug that fcshttp wasn't passing arguments correctly.

###New Features

- Added `getOnly()` method, which returns a subset of the full JSON.
- Added corresponding `--o=xxx` args to fcscli, and `?o=xxx` to fcshttp
--Added --addDate and --addFilename option to fcscli
- Throws exception on unusual $BYTEORD, only accepts 4,3,2,1 and 1,2,3,4.

###Misc

- Added this release-notes folder
- Updated fcshttp.html
- added Mocha unit tests, Travis-CI integration, and updated readme and package.json appropriately
